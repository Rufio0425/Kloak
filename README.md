## MessagesService

This is an application that I have created to learn and interact more with the **MEAN** stack. This application uses Angular2, Node.js, Mongo and Mongoose(to handle database calls and set up models). At times, handlebars is used to act as a template for the front-end

## Motivation

This project was built so that I could understand the **MEAN** stack and also **RESTful** API calls. I love developing and learning new technology is a hobby I live for!
